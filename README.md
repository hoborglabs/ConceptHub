# Concept Hub from Hoborg Labs

Concept Hub is a small project which aim to provide you with basic 
functionality for sharing your designs.

Right now it only gives you an options to list a folder, and preview
images with options to zoom in and zoom out.

## Standing on The Shoulders of Giants.

We are now using:

* twitter bootstrap css (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)
* backbone (http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone)
* jquery (http://jquery.com)
* underscore (http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore)
* node.js (http://nodejs.org)

We will be using shortly:

* assetic (https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic)
* jasmine (https://jasmine.github.io/)
* jenkins (http://jenkins-ci.org)


## Is it something for me?

If you want to share your application mockups and screenshots with your
clients, then it's something for you. 

It's free and opensource!
